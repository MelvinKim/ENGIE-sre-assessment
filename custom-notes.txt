Namespaces vs cgroups
Namespaces
- used to isolate resources
- limits what you can see
- processes within a PID namespace only see processes in the same PID namespace
- each PID namespace has it's own numbering staring at 1
- if PID namespace goes away (deleted), all the resources in the namespace are deleted
- Types of namespaces:
1. Network namespace
processes within a given network namespace get their own network namespace, get their own private network stack
including network interfaces, routing tables, iptable rules, sockets etc
You can move a network interface from one namespace to another
2. Mnt namespace
enable containers to mount resources in their namespaces
processes have their own root file system
processes can also have "private" mounts
mounts can be private or shared
the is no easy to pass along a mount from a namespace to another
3. UTS (UNIX Time-Sharing) namespace
allow containers to appear to have different host and domain names
4. IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
allow processes to have their own IPC semaphores, IPC message queues, IPC shared memory
5. User namespace
used to isolate processes' security-related identifiers and attributes eg User-IDs, Group-IDs
a process's user and group id can be different inside and outside a user namespace --> you can be a root
user inside a container, but outside the container you aren't a root user.


Cgroups
- used to limit resource usage eg CPU/memory etc
- limits what you can use
- Types of cgroups:
1. CPU Cgroups
used to limit CPU usage for containers
2. memory Cgroups
used to limit memory usage for containers
3. device Cgroups
used to limit device usage for containers


Git techniques
- Cherry-pick a commit
(a new commit SHA is created when you cherry pick a commit)
(you can cherry pick commits from any branch)
(you cannot cherry pick a merged commit)
git cherry-pick <commit-SHA>
git cherry-pick <range-of-commit-SHA>
- How to cherry-pick and edit the commit message
git cherry-pick <commit-SHA> --edit
- get current commits in single lines form
git log --oneline
- View the changes made a specific commit
git show <commit-SHA>
- switch/checkout a specific branch
git checkout <branch-name>
git switch <branch-name>
- How to create a diff patch
git diff <starting-commit-SHA>..<ending-commit-SHA> (don't forget the two dots between the two commits)
git diff <starting-commit-SHA>..<ending-commit-SHA> > output.txt
- How to apply a diff patch
git apply <file> eg
git apply output.txt
- How to create a new branch from a specific commit SHA
git switch -c <branch-name> <commit-SHA> eg
git switch -c test-branch 38382hs
- git restore a file
git restore <file> eg
git restore file.txt
